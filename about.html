        <h2>A brief History</h2>
        <div class="brief">
            <p>Found by Fusajiro Yamuchi in Kyoto 1889, Nintendo was orignally a producer of hand made Hanafuda playing cards. After almost a century as more hobbies became available, card sales drop and Nintendo expanded its business to table top games like Chess, Shogi, Go and Mahjong. Finally in 1973, Nintendo released its first console "The Color TV game". Ever since then Nintendo has been producing more consoles and games.</p>
